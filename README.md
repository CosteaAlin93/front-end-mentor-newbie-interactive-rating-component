- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- Extra: if no rating selected then show a message and do not continue

## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- JavaScript basics...really needed a refresher and this challenge was just fit for it.
- using hidden class from tailwind-css
- thinking about extra cases like: show message if no rating is selected

### Continued development

Next, would like to add different transitions like:

- once cliked the submit button, the card should dissapear smoothly and the thank you card appear with a transition

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display#hidden) - Tailwind-css documentation for hidden
